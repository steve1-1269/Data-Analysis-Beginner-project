# Data Analysis Project Collection 📊

This repository contains multiple exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects using real-world datasets. Each project explores data patterns, performs preprocessing, visualizes insights, and draws conclusions using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each notebook in this repository corresponds to a specific dataset and analysis objective. All files are self-contained and can be run independently.

### Notebooks Included:

1. **Sales Data Analysis**
   - Analyzes sales trends over time.
   - Combines monthly reports to find key sales drivers.
   - Visualizes popular products, best-performing months, and city-level insights.

2. **Netflix Dataset Analysis**
   - Examines content trends on Netflix.
   - Analyzes movie vs. TV show distribution, content release trends, and genre popularity.
   - Includes temporal and geographic visualizations.

3. **Movie Correlation Project**
   - Uses a movie metadata dataset to investigate correlations between different features like budget, gross revenue, and score.
   - Builds a correlation matrix and visual heatmaps.

4. **Weather Dataset Analysis**
   - Investigates temperature, wind speed, and weather condition trends.
   - Performs filtering and grouping to understand climate variations.

5. **Race Data Analysis**
   - Focuses on demographic or race-related trends (e.g., population data or race event data).
   - Performs categorical data analysis and comparison.

6. **EDa.ipynb**
   - A generic EDA notebook possibly used for template/experimentation.
   - Performs basic steps like data cleaning, null value handling, and visualization.
